# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms Overview

This document outlines the foundational elements of data structures and algorithms in a simplified format.

---

## 📂 Arrays
- **Fixed-size** linear data structure.
- Fast access by index: `O(1)`, but costly insertion/deletion: `O(n)`.

## 📚 Lists
- Python's `list` is a dynamic array.
- Supports efficient appending but slow insertion/removal in the middle.

## 🎯 Queue
- **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out).
- Enqueue at rear, dequeue from front. Used in scheduling, BFS.

## 🥞 Stack
- **LIFO** (Last-In-First-Out).
- Useful in recursion, expression evaluation, undo mechanisms.

## ⏮️ Deque
- Double-ended queue: insert/remove from both ends.
- Supports both queue and stack operations.

## 🔗 Linked List
- Dynamic size, sequential access.
- Efficient insertion/deletion but slow access by index.

## 🌳 Tree
- Hierarchical structure.
- Used in indexing (BST), heap, and hierarchical models (DOM).

## 🌐 Graph
- Set of nodes and edges.
- Models networks (social, transport), supports traversal (DFS, BFS), path-finding.

## 🔐 Hash Tables
- Key-value store with average `O(1)` access.
- Used in dictionaries, sets, and caches.

## 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- Arrange data in a specific order.
- Common: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.
- Applications in searching, optimization, and data processing.

## 🔗 Visual Learning
📌 [Visual Demonstrations of Concepts](https://visualgo.net/en/list)

Great for animations of lists, trees, graphs, sorting, and more.
