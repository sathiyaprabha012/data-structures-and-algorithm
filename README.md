# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms Overview

This document outlines the foundational elements of data structures and algorithms in a simplified format.

---

## 📂 Arrays
- **Definition**: Fixed-size collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Why Use**: Fast random access `O(1)` by index.
- **Trade-off**: Costly insertions/deletions `O(n)`.
- **Real-World**: Seating chart in a theater.

---

## 📚 Lists (Python Lists)
- **Definition**: Dynamic arrays that grow/shrink as needed.
- **Why Use**: Flexibility to store any type; great for appending.
- **Trade-off**: Slow for mid-list insertions.
- **Real-World**: Shopping list that grows with your needs.

---

## 🎯 Queue
- **Definition**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
- **Why Use**: Orderly processing — first come, first served.
- **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, print queues, BFS.
- **Real-World**: People waiting in line.

---

## 🥞 Stack
- **Definition**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
- **Why Use**: Reversals, undo operations, function calls.
- **Use Cases**: Backtracking, recursion stack.
- **Real-World**: Stack of plates — take the top one first.

---

## ⏮️ Deque
- **Definition**: Double-ended queue.
- **Why Use**: Insertion/removal from both ends.
- **Use Cases**: Sliding window problems, palindrome checkers.
- **Real-World**: Train with doors on both ends.

---

## 🔗 Linked List
- **Definition**: Nodes connected via pointers.
- **Why Use**: Dynamic memory usage, fast insertions/removals.
- **Trade-off**: No fast indexing.
- **Use Cases**: Browser history, playlists.
- **Types**: Singly, Doubly, Circular.

---

## 🌳 Tree
- **Definition**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships.
- **Why Use**: Organize data for fast lookup, insertion.
- **Use Cases**: File systems, XML parsers, binary search.
- **Real-World**: Family tree or organizational chart.

---

## 🌐 Graph
- **Definition**: Collection of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges).
- **Why Use**: Model relationships, paths, and networks.
- **Use Cases**: Maps, social networks, recommendation systems.
- **Types**: Directed, undirected, weighted, cyclic, etc.

---

## 🔐 Hash Table
- **Definition**: Key-value mapping with hashing.
- **Why Use**: Fast lookup, insertion, deletion `O(1)` average.
- **Use Cases**: Dictionaries, caches, sets.
- **Real-World**: Index cards with unique labels.

---

## 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- **Goal**: Arrange data in a specific order.
- **Popular Ones**:
  - **Bubble Sort** – Easy but slow (`O(n²)`).
  - **Insertion Sort** – for almost sorted list (`O(n²)`).
  - **Merge Sort** – Fast and stable (`O(n log n)`).
  - **Quick Sort** – Fast average case, `O(n log n)`, but `O(n²)` worst case.
  - **Heap Sort** – Priority queue-based, `O(n log n)`.
- **Use Cases**: Search optimizations, rankings, data analysis.
