'''
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers 
where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, 
return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
